# bash-pipelines
This is a series of pipelines for computational biology. 

They are bash scripts written for specific projects that I have slowly tried to adapt to be more universal.

They were written by a beginner (who hopefully improved over time), with the aim of taking output of one piece of software and sending it to another.

I can make no guarantees that they will produce appropriate output for your task

At time of writing some have lines that point to specific directories (particularly for software or scripts) that won't exist for you and will require editing
