# bash-pipelines
This is a series of pipelines for computational biology. They are bash scripts written (poorly) for specific projects that I have slowly tried to adapt to be more universal. They were written by a beginner, with the aim of taking output of one piece of software and sending it to another. No guarantees can be made that they will produce appropriate output for your task


At time of writing many have lines that point to specific directories that won't exist for you and will require editing

QandD=quick and dirty
