	[We now need to set the priors for our model. There are six types of parameters in the model: the topology, the branch 		lengths, the four stationary frequencies of the nucleotides, the six different nucleotide substitution rates, the 		proportion of invariable sites, and the shape parameter of the gamma distribution of rate variation. The default priors 	in MrBayes work well for most analyses, and we will not change any of them for now. By typing help prset you can obtain 	a list of the default settings for the parameters in your model.]

	[prset brlenspr=unconstrained:gammadir(1.0,0.1,1.0,1.0); The Brlenspr parameter can either be set to unconstrained or clock-constrained. For trees without a molecular clock (unconstrained) the branch length prior can be set either to exponential or uniform. The default exponential prior with parameter 10.0 should work well for most analyses. It has an expectation of 1/10 = 0.1 but allows a wide range of branch length values (theoretically from 0 to infinity). Because the likelihood values vary much more rapidly for short branches than for long branches, an exponential prior on branch lengths is closer to being uninformative than a uniform prior.]
